# A Data-Centric Study of Languages in South Asia

This project explores the interconnectedness among languages within South Asia using powerful visualization tools like Pythonâ€™s matplotlib and geopandas packages. It was developed as part of the 'Islam in South Asia through Literature and Film' course.

## Project Overview

### Motivation
The rich tapestry of historical texts and films studied in the course, particularly the nuanced portrayals of languages and poetry, inspired this project. The exploration began with the analysis of the Jambu dataset, a cognate database of South Asian languages, to craft various spatial plots.

### Key Visualizations
- **Thematic Map**: Displaying languages by clade.
- **Spatial Plots**: Various plots derived from geospatial data, focusing on language distribution.

## Files in the Repository
- `SAS345_FinalProject_KG.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the [Jambu Dataset GitHub repository](https://github.com/moli-mandala/data).
